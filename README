patches
	The patches made to BOINC itself for a couple obscure features, bugfixes, 
	and debugging information.
result-analysis
	If you'd like to review my math and estimations for the pretty graphs,
	for GNFS stuff or cracking, here it is. 
sample-server
	This is the config files and most importantly templates for the boinc 
	applications.
scripts
	These are the job generation scripts, post-run analysis scripts, and some 
	other misc scripts.
wordlists

Be Intelligent
============================================================
In general, you're going to want to search for tmp_hostname and replace that 
with your temporary directory, and overall just read the stuff to see what you 
have to change.  I didn't make a note of everytime I removed my password and
put in PASSWORD for you to fill in.

I recommend you read all the READMEs in the directories.

No Wordlists
============================================================
I'm not including my wordlists.  Not out of secrecy, I just downloaded every 
single one I could find, stripped out the copyrights on them, and combined them.  
So I'm fairly certain doing so would be in violation of the wishes of the 
authors.  Yea, I know almost no one actually obeys that stuff, but I try to most
of the time.  You can combine your own wordlists.

Thanks
